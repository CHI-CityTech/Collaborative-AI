# üìò Collaborative AI Resources

This resource provides a comprehensive and evolving set of materials for exploring human‚ÄìAI collaboration through the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework. It includes curriculum for both introductory and intermediate courses, research tools, theoretical foundations, and access to active meta-projects where AI is treated not merely as a tool, but as a collaborative partner. Designed under the principles of the Center for Holistic Integration (CHI), this repository supports cross-disciplinary learning, open experimentation, and real-world implementation. Materials include lesson plans, GitHub project templates, performance environments, syntax development, and invitations to join or extend ongoing collaborative research.  We divide these resources into several broad categories:  

## üìö Collaborative AI ‚Äì Top-Level Structure

This Open Educational Resource is organized into three primary categories, each focused on a different mode of engagement with Collaborative AI. All supporting tools, templates, and repositories are nested within these categories.
1. [Curriculum : Teaching CAI](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Collaborative-AI/new/main#-1-curriculum-teaching-collaborative-ai)
2. [Frameworks: Understanding CAI](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Collaborative-AI/new/main#-2-frameworks-understanding-collaborative-ai)  
3. [Applied Projects: Practicing CAI](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Collaborative-AI/new/main#-2-frameworks-understanding-collaborative-ai)

In addition, as part of our call for participation, we provide a list of currwnt and proposed projects, each performaning an investigation into

## üåê Collaboration, Meta-Projects & Expansion

This Open Educational Resource is not just a collection of static materials that you can use within your own pedagogical efforts (although we strongly support you to use it in this way!)‚Äîit is an **invitation to participate** in an active, interdisciplinary investigation of Collaborative AI. In the spirit of the **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)**, we welcome contributors from all disciplines to explore, expand, and co-develop the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework and its applications.

Whether you are a student, educator, researcher, artist, engineer, or theorist, there is a place for your voice in this collaborative structure. Participation can take many forms‚Äîfrom engaging in live research, developing original content, adapting frameworks to new fields, or launching new meta-projects that bring AI into meaningful partnership with human cognition.

We encourage contributors to:
- Propose new meta-projects using the provided templates  
- Extend or remix existing BBS-aligned projects  
- Document their collaboration using GitHub Issues and versioned reflections  
- Align their work with CHI's model of long-term, cross-semester integration

# üß≠ CHI Research Onboarding Guide  

This guide outlines the onboarding process for students, faculty, and collaborators interested in conducting research within the **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** ecosystem. CHI operates through **Meta-Projects**‚Äîexpansive, interdisciplinary research and creative environments that transcend semesters and encourage long-term collaboration.

At the heart of CHI‚Äôs philosophy is the belief that **integration must be holistic**, involving all disciplines, modalities, and forms of intelligence. New researchers are invited not only to join existing projects, but to shape them‚Äîand, when needed, propose new ones.

## üîÑ Onboarding Steps

### 1. üß© Self-Reflection: Define Your Research Direction

Before joining a project, take time to reflect on your personal and professional goals:

- What **skills** do I want to learn or develop?
- What **career path** or domain do I hope to explore?
- What **topics, mediums, or methods** interest me most?
- What is my current comfort level with **AI collaboration**?

This step creates a foundation for identifying the type of research environment or project that best aligns with your growth goals.

---

### 2. üìö Explore Current and Upcoming Opportunities

Next, explore CHI‚Äôs existing and proposed projects:

- Review descriptions in the [Student Research Repository](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/StudentResearch)
- Visit the [Spring 2025 Research Opportunities](https://chi-citytech.github.io/Spring_2025_Project_Opportunities)
- A more speculative set of potential projects can be found in the [research area of the BBS site](https://sites.google.com/view/balancedblendedspace/projects)
- Investigate existing project [proposals](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/StudentResearch/tree/main/Proposals_Spring_2025) and repositories for further ideas or to join in an already existing project.  

You don‚Äôt need to make a perfect match ‚Äî just begin identifying areas that seem exciting or potentially meaningful.

---

### 3. üó£Ô∏è Meet with a Meta-Project Coordinator

Schedule a conversation with a CHI **Meta-Project Coordinator** to talk through your ideas. This meeting is a guided session to:

- Share your reflections and early project interests
- Learn more about how the meta-project structure works
- Receive suggestions for how your interests might align with CHI‚Äôs ecosystem
- Consider integration into existing teams or thematic areas

---

### 4. üõ†Ô∏è Propose a New Research Direction (Optional)

If none of the current project strands fully align with your goals, you are invited to:

- Propose a new project, problem, or area of exploration
- Work with the coordinator to shape your concept into a viable research pathway
- Consider how it could fit within the CHI meta-project framework and the BBS model

---

### 5. ü§ù Collaborative Framing and Proposal Development

Once a general direction is identified, the next step is to **refine and formalize your research idea**. This happens in two stages:

#### üîç 5a. Exploratory Framing with the Onboarding Coordinator

In a follow-up session with your coordinator:

- Clarify what you want to contribute or investigate
- Identify how your project might engage with AI, physical systems, or conceptual modeling
- Begin sketching how it could fit within the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework
- Receive input on suitable tools, modalities, and peer collaborators

This step ensures you‚Äôre not working in isolation ‚Äî you‚Äôre supported in identifying connections and potential contributions to the broader meta-project environment.

#### ü§ñ 5b. Proposal Development through Human‚ÄìAI Collaboration

Next, you‚Äôll work with your onboarding coordinator and an AI system (e.g., ChatGPT) to co-develop your research proposal. This collaboration may involve:

- Refining your **question or design goal**
- Structuring **tasks and deliverables**
- Exploring BBS **mediation pathways** and AI roles
- Drafting the initial proposal text with iterative AI input

This process embodies the CHI philosophy that **AI should be treated as a collaborative partner**, not just a tool.

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Finalize Scope and Begin Work

After your proposal is complete:

- A clear set of expectations, deliverables, and milestones is documented
- You‚Äôll be added to the appropriate GitHub repository or a new one will be created
- You will officially onboard into your team or project cluster
- Work begins, with regular opportunities for feedback, documentation, and revision

---

## üå± Why This Process?

This onboarding experience is designed to:

- Empower you to pursue **self-directed, meaningful research**
- Support your ability to **collaborate with AI as a partner**
- Help you connect with **others across disciplines**
- Promote **long-term integration** into CHI‚Äôs meta-project ecosystem

Whether you‚Äôre here to explore art, code, design, performance, theory, systems engineering, or storytelling ‚Äî this process supports your unique journey while linking it to a broader vision of collaborative intelligence.
